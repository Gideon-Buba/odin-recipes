    <li>In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with some Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. </li>
    <li>Assemble the lasagna by spreading a layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a baking dish. Add a layer of the cooked lasagna noodles on top, followed by a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat these layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top. </li>
